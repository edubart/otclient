vc12:
so, we need libs/dll 32/64bit i believe someone give as this
with debug info/symbols please add _d to his name like yourlib_d.lib
example 32bit lib:
in folder         LuaJIT/lib/
                            lua51.lib
(debug) in folder LuaJIT/lib/
                            lua51_d.lib

example 64bit lib:
in folder         LuaJIT/lib64/
                              lua51.lib
(debug) in folder LuaJIT/lib64/
                              lua51_d.lib
in OTCLIENT_LIBDEPS i added some thinks:
    kernel32.lib;
    user32.lib;
    shell32.lib;
    gdi32.lib;
    advapi32.lib;
because of weird linker errors
